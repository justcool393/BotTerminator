# What does it do?

It bans spam bots. If you've ever seen one of those comment reply bots that are heavily discouraged by the Reddit admins and API rules, then these are the bots BotTerminator bans. It serves the exact same function that /u/BotBust and /u/BotWatchman previously served.

# Invite the bot!

Go to the moderators page for your subreddit and invite the bot with at least `access` and `posts` permissions. If you want subreddit specific customization or would like that option in the future, you may also grant it `wiki` permissions.

If you don't know how to invite a moderator, [the Help Center has information](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009381491) ([see here for classic Reddit](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002988131-Moderators-and-Permissions)).

# FAQ

## A bot that I want in my sub is banned by BotTerminator! Can I have it not check this bot?

Sure! Add either the class `btproof` to the user. `botbustproof` will also work, but it is considered deprecated and shouldn't be used.

## Could this be used to ban regular users?

It could, but it won't. If we messed up, please send a modmail, and we'll get it corrected right away.
